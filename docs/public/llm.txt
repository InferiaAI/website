# Inferia - AI Inference Platform

**Website**: https://inferia.ai

## Overview

Inferia LLM is a comprehensive orchestration platform designed to manage the lifecycle of Large Language Model (LLM) inference. It bridges the gap between raw compute providers (Cloud, On-Prem, DePIN) and end-user applications.

## What We Do

At its core, Inferia provides a unified API to access models running across a distributed network of compute nodes, ensuring high availability, security, and performance.

## Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: OpenAI-compatible endpoints for seamless integration with existing tools and libraries
- **Security First**: Built-in Filtration Gateway provides PII redaction, prompt injection protection, and content safety scanning
- **Orchestration**: Intelligent routing and job management across diverse compute pools (Kubernetes, SkyPilot, Nosana)
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and metrics via the Dashboard for full visibility into usage and performance

## System Components

Inferia consists of three main modular gateways:

1. **Inference Gateway**: The high-performance entry point for API requests
2. **Filtration Gateway**: The security engine responsible for guardrails and policy enforcement
3. **Orchestration Gateway**: The control plane that manages compute resources and model deployments
