We welcome contributions! This guide will help you set up your development environment and understand our workflows.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork and Clone**: Start by forking the repository and cloning it locally.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the development dependencies for the `inferia` package.
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
3.  **Create a Branch**: Always work on a feature branch (`feat/new-adapter`, `fix/login-bug`).

## Code Style

We enforce code quality using standard Python tooling.

-   **Formatter**: We use `black` for code formatting.
    ```bash
    black .
    ```
-   **Linter**: We use `ruff` (or `flake8`) for linting.
-   **Type Checking**: Type hints are strongly encouraged.

## Running Tests

We use `pytest` for our test suite.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=inferia
```

## Syncing Code

The project uses a monorepo structure where the source of truth is the `services/` directory. If you modify code in `services/`, you must sync it to the `package/` directory before building or testing the package.

**Use the helper script:**

```bash
./sync_package.sh
```

This ensures that `package/src/inferia/services/` matches `services/`.

## Pull Requests

1.  Push your branch to your fork.
2.  Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
3.  Ensure all CI checks pass (linting, tests).
4.  Provide a clear description of your changes.
