InferiaLLM employs a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system to ensure that users only have access to the resources they are authorized to use. This system covers authentication, authorization, and organization-level security.

## Authentication

InferiaLLM uses standard **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication.

### Login Flow
1.  User submits credentials (username/password) to `/auth/login`.
2.  If **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is enabled, the user must also provide a TOTP code.
3.  The server returns an `access_token` (short-lived) and a `refresh_token` (long-lived).
4.  The client includes the `access_token` in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all subsequent requests.

### Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)
For enhanced security, users can enable TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
- **Setup**: Users are shown a QR code to scan.
- **Enforcement**: Administrators can enforce 2FA for all organization members.

## Authorization (RBAC)

Permissions in InferiaLLM are granular but grouped into **Roles** for easier management.

### Roles
- **Owner**: Full access to the organization, including billing and destructive actions.
- **Admin**: Can manage users, deployments, and policies but cannot delete the organization.
- **Member**: Can view resources and use inference endpoints.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access.

### Permissions Reference

The system enforces permissions at the API level. Below is a reference of key permissions:

| Category | Permission | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployments** | `deployment:create` | Launch new model deployments. |
| | `deployment:delete` | Terminate running deployments. |
| **API Keys** | `api_key:create` | Generate new API keys for inference. |
| | `api_key:revoke` | Revoke existing API keys. |
| **Members** | `member:invite` | Invite new users to the organization. |
| | `member:delete` | Remove users from the organization. |
| **Knowledge Base** | `knowledge_base:add_data` | Upload documents to collections. |
| **Audit Logs** | `audit_log:view` | View security and usage logs. |

## Network Security

- **Internal Gateway**: Services communicate via a secured internal gateway that validates service-to-service tokens.
- **Isolation**: Each organization's resources (deployments, documents) are logically isolated.
- **Secrets Management**: Sensitive values (like cloud provider keys) are encrypted at rest.
