InferiaLLM uses an **Organization** structure to manage users, resources (pools, deployments), and policies within your instance.

## Managing Members

### Inviting Users
You can invite new members via email.

1.  Go to **Settings > Members**.
2.  Click **Invite Member**.
3.  Enter their email address.
4.  Select a **Role** (e.g., Member, Admin).
5.  Click **Send Invite**.

The user will receive an email with a unique link to join the organization. If the SMTP service is not configured, you can copy the invite link manually from the pending invitations list.

### Revoking Access
To remove a user:
1.  Go to **Settings > Members**.
2.  Find the user in the list.
3.  Click the **Remove** icon.
4.  Confirm the action.

The user's API keys associated with this organization will explicitly remain valid until manually revoked, but they will lose access to organization resources immediately.
