InferiaLLM supports multi-tenant organization management with user invitations and role assignments.

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level tenant boundary. All resources (deployments, API keys, etc.) belong to an organization.

### Create Organization

Organizations are created during initial setup or by super admins.

### Organization Settings

Access via **Settings > Organization**:

- Organization name
- Default settings
- Billing information (if applicable)

## User Management

### Listing Users

View all users in your organization:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Changing User Roles

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/admin/users/{user_id}/role \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "developer"}'
```

## Invitations

### Invite a User

1. Go to **Settings > Users**
2. Click **Invite User**
3. Enter email and select role
4. Send invitation

Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register-invite \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "role": "developer"
  }'
```

### Accept Invitation

Users receive an invitation link that leads to the registration page.

```bash
# Get invitation details
curl http://localhost:8000/auth/invitations/{token}

# Accept invitation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/accept-invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "invitation-token",
    "password": "newpassword123",
    "name": "New User"
  }'
```

## Multi-Organization Access

Users can belong to multiple organizations:

### List Organizations

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/auth/organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Switch Organization

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/switch-org \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"org_id": "target-org-uuid"}'
```

This returns new tokens scoped to the target organization.
