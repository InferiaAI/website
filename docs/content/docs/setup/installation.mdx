---

This guide provides detailed instructions for installing and configuring Inferia LLM. Depending on your use case, you can choose between installing the **Python Package** (recommended for general usage) or setting up **Individual Services** manually (recommended for contributors).

## System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

| Component | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OS** | Linux / macOS | Windows is supported via WSL2. |
| **Python** | 3.10+ | Core runtime for all services. |
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Required for the Orchestration Sidecar (Nosana). |
| **PostgreSQL** | 14+ | Primary database for application state. |
| **Redis** | 6+ | Message broker for task queues. |

## 1. Environment Configuration

Regardless of your installation method, you need to configure the core environment variables.

1.  **Clone the Repository** (Required for configuration files):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/inferiallm/inferiallm.git
    cd inferiallm
    ```

2.  **Initialize Configuration**:
    Copy the sample environment file. This file acts as the single source of truth for all services.
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

3.  **Edit `.env`**:
    Update the file with your specific credentials.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must set `POSTGRES_DSN`, `REDIS_URL`, and `INTERNAL_API_KEY` for the system to function.

## 2. Option A: Python Package (Recommended)

The easiest way to install and manage Inferia is via the official Python package.

### Standard Installation
Installs the latest stable version from PyPI.

```bash
pip install inferiallm
```

### Developer Installation
If you are developing the package itself or need the latest source changes:

```bash
# Editable install for active development
cd package
pip install -e .

# OR: Build and install a wheel
pip install build
python -m build
pip install dist/inferia-*.whl
```

### Database Initialization
Once the package is installed, initialize the database schema. This command uses your `.env` configuration.

```bash
inferiallm init
```

## 3. Option B: Run Services Individually (CLI)

If you prefer to run services individually for debugging, use the `inferia` CLI commands.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you have activated your virtual environment.

### Inference Gateway
The entry point for API requests.

```bash
inferiallm inference-gateway
```

### Filtration Gateway
The security layer for content safety and policy enforcement.

```bash
inferiallm filtration-gateway
# Note: Ensure internal API keys match in .env
```

### Orchestration Gateway
The control plane for managing compute pools and deployments.

```bash
inferiallm orchestration-gateway
```

### Dashboard
Runs the management UI on port 3001.

> Note: The dashboard is part of the `inferiallm api-start` command, but purely static files can be served via standard tools if needed. For development, use `api-start`.

## 4. Option C: Docker Compose (Full Stack)

For a complete, containerized deployment including the Dashboard, use Docker Compose.

### Steps

1.  **Configure Environment**:
    ```bash
    cd deploy
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

2.  **Start Services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Access Services**:
    - **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001
    - **Orchestrator**: http://localhost:8080
    - **Filtration**: http://localhost:8000
