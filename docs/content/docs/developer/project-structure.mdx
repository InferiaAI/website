---

Inferia LLM follows a structured monorepo pattern to separate executable applications from reusable core libraries.

## Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`apps/`** | Deployment entry points (Gateways, Dashboard, Docs). |
| **`package/`** | The public Python package (`inferia`) containing all core logic and services. |
| **`deploy/`** | Infrastructure-as-Code (Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests). |

## 1. Apps (`apps/`)

These are the runnable services that get deployed.

-   **`inference-gateway/`**: Entry point for API requests.
-   **`filtration-gateway/`**: Entry point for safety guardrails.
-   **`orchestration-gateway/`**: Entry point for orchestration.
-   **`docs/`**: This documentation site (built with Mintlify).
-   **`dashboard/`**: React/Next.js frontend for the management console.

## 2. Package (`package/`)

This directory contains the source code for the `inferia` package. **All core logic lives here.**

-   **`src/inferia/services/`**: Core business logic (inference, filtration, orchestration).
-   **`src/inferia/cli.py`**: The `inferia` command-line interface entry point.
-   **`src/inferia/gateways/`**: Gateway implementation details.

## 3. Deploy (`deploy/`)

-   **`.env`**: Centralized environment configuration.
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Definition for running the entire stack locally.
