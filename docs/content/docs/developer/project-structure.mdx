---

Inferia LLM follows a structured monorepo pattern to separate executable applications from reusable core libraries.

## Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`apps/`** | Frontend Applications (Dashboard, Documentation). |
| **`package/`** | The public Python package (`inferia`) containing all core logic, services, and gateways. |
| **`deploy/`** | Infrastructure-as-Code (Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests). |

## 1. Apps (`apps/`)

These are the frontend user interfaces.

-   **`dashboard/`**: React (Vite) frontend for the management console.
-   **`docs/`**: This documentation site (built with Next.js).

## 2. Package (`package/`)

This directory contains the source code for the `inferia` Python package. **All backend logic lives here.**

-   **`src/inferia/gateways/`**:
    -   `inference_gateway/`: High-performance proxy for API requests.
    -   `filtration_gateway/`: Security layer for guardrails and policy.
    -   `orchestration_gateway/`: Control plane for compute pools and deployments.
-   **`src/inferia/services/`**: Core business logic modules (used by gateways).
-   **`src/inferia/cli.py`**: The `inferia` command-line interface entry point.

## 3. Deploy (`deploy/`)

-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Definition for running the entire stack locally.
-   **`.env`**: Centralized environment configuration.
